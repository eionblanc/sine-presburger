Computations and visualizations to augment the paper "Decidability bounds for Presburger arithmetic extended by sine" by [Eion Blanchard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eionblanchard/) and [Philipp Hieronymi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-hieronymi-257b916b). See preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00099).

Visualization of approximating differences under sine to help encode the undecidable weak monadic second-order theory of the grid in sin-PA.

Visualization of feasible-boundary level sets for a conjunction of linear-sine inequalities to reduce variables for simplifying the existential sin-PA decision procedure.
